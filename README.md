## **Project Overview**

The **Social Media Engagement Dashboard** delivers a clear and interactive view of how different post types, platforms, and publishing days influence engagement outcomes. It highlights total engagement trends, identifies high-performing posts, and presents actionable insights to improve content performance.

This project showcases skills in:

* Data modeling & DAX calculations (Power BI)
* Dashboard layout design & storytelling
* Trend analysis and KPI development
* Insight extraction based on user behavior data

---

## **Tools & Technologies**

* **Power BI** – data modeling, DAX measures, interactive visuals
* **CSV / Excel** – raw dataset

---

## **Key Insights**

* **Total Engagement** is heavily driven by a few high-performing posts, showing strong spikes in the engagement trend.
* **Post Type** significantly influences engagement — visually rich media (e.g., reels, videos, images) consistently outperform other formats.
* **Engagement over time** shows noticeable fluctuations, indicating specific days or periods where audience activity is stronger.
* Posts that achieved the **highest engagement** share common patterns that can be replicated for future performance.
* **Comments per post** are relatively low on average, suggesting limited deeper interaction despite high likes.

---

## **Recommendations**

* **Increase posting frequency on high-engagement days** identified in the trend chart to maximize audience activity.
* Continue focusing on **high-performing post types** (e.g., reels/videos) since they drive the strongest overall engagement.
* **Replicate successful post characteristics** from top-engaged posts—such as format, visual style, captions, timing, or topic.
* Encourage deeper interaction by adding **CTAs for comments**, question prompts, and interactive caption formats.
* Monitor platform-specific performance and allocate more content or ad budget to platforms showing stronger engagement.
