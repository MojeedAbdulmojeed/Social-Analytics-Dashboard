# 📊 **Social Media Engagement Dashboard — README**

## 📝 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing social media engagement data to uncover performance patterns across post types, dates, and content interactions.
Using **Power BI**, the dashboard visualizes how audiences react to content and provides clear, data-driven recommendations for improving future performance.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

This analysis aims to:

* Measure overall engagement performance
* Identify which post types generate the most impact
* Track engagement trends over time
* Highlight top-performing posts
* Provide practical recommendations for content strategy

---

## 🔧 **Tools & Technologies**

* **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard development
* **Excel / CSV** – Dataset structure and preparation

---

## 📈 **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

The dashboard tracks four major KPIs:

* **Total Engagement**
* **Average Engagement per Post**
* **Average Comments per Post**
* **Highest Engaged Post**

Each KPI includes:

* Month-over-month comparison
* Trend sparkline (micro-visual)
* Color-coded indicator (green = improved, red = decline)

---

## 📊 **Dashboard Visuals**

1. **Total Engagement by Post Type** – Bar Chart
2. **Engagement Trend Over Time** – Line Chart
3. **Likes vs Comments vs Shares** – Column Chart
4. **Top 10 Engaged Posts** – Matrix Table
5. *(Optional)* Additional visual for category or sentiment analysis

---

## 🔍 **Insights Summary**

* High-interaction content types generate the strongest engagement.
* Certain days show consistently higher performance, indicating optimal posting times.
* A small set of posts drives a large portion of total engagement — these formats are worth replicating.

---

## 💡 **Recommendations**

* Increase posting frequency on high-performing days.
* Prioritize high-engagement post types (e.g., reels, videos).
* Analyze the structure of top-performing posts and replicate similar formats.
* Use comments and shares to identify content that creates meaningful audience interaction.
